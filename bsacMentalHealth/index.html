                We aim to establish mental health awareness through advocacy, support, and
                education. This can become a reality by enhancing the school curriculum,
                through the implementation of yearly health classes. This class would allow
                students to gain insight toward the issue, as they would be
                introduced to the evolution of this growing issue. In addition, we hope to
                change D.O.E policy by mandating a minimum of two guest speakers a year. In
                hopes that providing the student body with someone they can sympathize with
                will illustrate that they are not alone and encourage them to speak up.

                The feeling of sadness, worthlessness, and restlessness has caused a huge
                impact to our youth. With the rise of social media, which enables one to
                be judged and ridiculed by others has been linked to the spread of mental
                illness issues. <br><br>

                In simple terms, it can be caused by many factors such as
                <ul>
                  <span class="li">
                  <li>-Familial issues</li>

                  <li>-Chronic illnesses or other physical conditions</li>
                  <li>-Untreated mental or substance-abuse problems</li>

                  <li>-Being exposed to a multitude of opinions (on tv & online)</li>
                  <li>-Gender confusion</li>
                  <li>-Early access to, and the acceptance of illegal drugs</li>

                  The mental health of our generation is slowly depreciating and it will only
                get worse as time goes on. Society is ignoring the important signs as they
                believe that they can help themselves, because of their beliefs that nothing
                is wrong with them. This fixed mindset can not continue. In order to combat
                this growing issue, the school community needs to enhance the curriculum and
                invest more time into the wellbeing of the students.
                  When teenagers take matters into their own hands their solution is self-harm,
                such as cutting themselves, Bulimia (binging & purging), and even taking their life.
