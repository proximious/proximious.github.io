      Even though computers have positively contributed to our technology standards,
      society has to realize that computers can have a negative effect on people's
      identity. Despite the fact that computers have greatly improved our lives and
      society we must also become aware of the negative impact it can have on
      individuals if not used responsibly. With a little over half of the American
      population using the internet, it is significantly important that we place
      close attention to the impact computers have on people's lives. The extreme
      increase in the use of computers has drastically changed the lives of many
      people. Computers initially were used as simple calculators, but through
      the years they have come to be valued as more than simple machines. Some
      of the impacts computershave on people can be negative.
