     The development of the computer has been a drastic one, from when they were capable of
     occupying an entire room to being able to sit comfortably on your lap. The people who
     have assisted in the computer's development were Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage, and Alan Turing.
     Lovelace was the first person to write computer programs. Charles Babbage designed a machine called
     the Analytical Machine, it was later classified as the first computer. Alan Turing created machines
     during war that allowed people to read secret coded messages, he was later proclaimed as the father
     of Computer Science.
